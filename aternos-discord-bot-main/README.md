# aternos discord bot
Simple [Aternos](https://aternos.org/) discord bot to start & stop your Minecraft server.

Built using [aternos-api](https://github.com/sleeyax/aternos-api).

**If you're here looking for an invite link, read [termination of the public (demo) bot](https://github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot/discussions/61).**

## Screenshots
Starting and stopping the server is fully **asynchronous**. You can query the current status at any time:

And you'll get notified once the server goes online or offline:

## Self-hosting
Instructions to host this bot yourself. If you were expecting an invite link, read [termination of the public (demo) bot](https://github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot/discussions/61).

Replit is not supported for hosting because it's IP banned by aternos/cloudflare.

Requirements: 
- VPS or spare computer
- Discord bot token
- MongoDB database (optional)

Configuration parameters are set through environment variables.
Variables that don't exist or are empty `=""` will be ignored.

<details>
 <summary>Click to show all parameters</summary>

`DISCORD_TOKEN`

Create a new discord app [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), add a bot to the application and copy and paste the token into this environment variable.

`MONGO_DB_URI`

Mongodb [connection string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/). Create a database named `aternos-discord-bot`.
This is only required if you want to serve multiple discord servers.

`ATERNOS_SESSION`

Copy and paste your `ATERNOS_SESSION` cookie here. This is only required if you don't want to use MongoDB. Credentials are stored in memory.

`ATERNOS_SERVER`

Copy and paste your `ATERNOS_SERVER` cookie here. This is only required if you don't want to use MongoDB. Credentials are stored in memory.

`PROXY`

HTTP(S) proxy to use for all outgoing connections. This should preferably be a stable rotating proxy when applied in production.

**Warning: proxies are currently in a broken state, see [this issue](https://github.com/sleeyax/aternos-api/issues/4). Help wanted.**

### Builds
There's several ways to get this bot up and running in production.

#### CLI binary
Download the binary from [releases](https://github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot/releases) or [compile it](#source), set the required environment variables & run the bot.

Linux/MacOS:
```
$ DISCORD_TOKEN="" MONGO_DB_URI="" ./aternos-discord-bot
``` 

Windows:
```
$ set DISCORD_TOKEN=<value>
$ set MONGO_DB_URI=<value>
$ aternos-discord-bot.exe
```

Other platforms:

Set the environment variables locally (or globally, if you must) and run the binary. It will show an error message when the required variables aren't set. RTFM if you don't know how to do this.

#### Source
Compilation instructions (requires Go version 1.18+):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot.git
$ cd aternos-discord-bot
$ go build -o aternos-discord-bot ./cmd/main.go
```

This should create a binary targeting your current platform. Follow the [CLI binary](#cli-binary) instructions to execute it.

#### Docker
You can also run the bot in a docker container:

`docker run -d --name aternos-discord-bot -e DISCORD_TOKEN="" -e MONGO_DB_URI="" sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot`

You can use docker compose to spin up a local MongoDB database as well (only recommended for development though):

`docker-compose up -d`

See [scripts](./scripts/docker) for a production-ready installation script that does most of the Docker setup for you on a Linux VPS.

#### Kubernetes
Deployment to a kubernetes cluster is also supported. 

1. Create a new namespace (optional): `kubectl create ns aternos-discord-bot`
2. Create a new secret containing the necessary environment variables (replace `<>` with the respective values): `kubectl create secret generic aternos-secrets --from-literal=DISCORD_TOKEN=<> --from-literal=ATERNOS_SERVER=<> --from-literal=MONGO_DB_URI=<> --from-literal=ATERNOS_SESSION=<>`
3. Publish the deployment: `kubectl apply -n aternos-discord-bot -f ./kubernestes.yaml` **WARNING** you'll most likely need to edit this configuration for your specific needs. Feel free to create a PR with proper helm chart support.

## Advanced
It's possible to integrate this package into existing go code. 
Useful if you want to further customize the bot or want to do additional things after launching it. 

Installation:

`go get github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot`

Code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	discord "github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot"
	database "github.com/sleeyax/aternos-discord-bot/database"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
)

func main() {
	// Create bot instance with an in-memory database (only supports 1 discord server).
	bot := discord.Bot{
		DiscordToken:  "<your discord bot token>",
		Database: &database.MemoryDatabase{}, // no initial values are provided, so they must be set with `/configure` later on
	}
	
	// Start the bot (errors are omitted for simplicity reasons).
	bot.Start()
	
	// Stop the bot when the main function ends.
	defer bot.Stop()
	
	// You can put some additional code here, for example. 
	//...

	// Block the main thread so the bot keeps running.
	// In this case we wait until 'CTRL + C' or another termination signal is received.
	fmt.Println("Bot is now running.  Press CTRL-C to exit.")
	interruptSignal := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(interruptSignal, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM, os.Interrupt, os.Kill)
	<-interruptSignal
}
```
