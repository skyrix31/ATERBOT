__Common problems and solutions__

**I just set up a new server but I can't start it!**
Go to aternos.org, manually start your server *once* and accept the EULA when prompted. From now on you should be able to start your server from the discord bot.

**I logged out on aternos.org and now my bot doesn't work!**
This is expected behaviour. You must reconfigure the bot with /configure whenever your credentials expire. At the moment there are no plans to implement username:password authentication.
